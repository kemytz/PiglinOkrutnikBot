# Piglin Okrutnik Bot

Piglin Okruntik Bot calculates position of a desired entity based on 3 F3+C measurements and render distance.

- Measurements require player to use pie chart in game correctly (root.tick.level.entities)
- Order of measurements matters
- FIRST and THIRD measurement should be done when the desired entity is visible on pie chart (measurements cannot be done in the same position - the bot informs you when that happens)
- SECOND measurement should be done when the desired entity is NOT visible on pie chart
- Render distance has to be set manually
- Measurements has to be reset manually
